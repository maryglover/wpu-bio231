- Identify aquatic invertebrate species and calculate a bioassessment index
- Interpret data to evaluate overall water quality in local streams

## Course resources

### Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Resources and readings will be provided to students throughout the semester. 

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is an excellent introduction and resource for using R software for data analysis. This is a free online textbook. 

### Technological requirements

In order to be successful in this class, students should have access to a personal laptop computer with internet access. Students will use the computer for data analysis in class. *A tablet will not work for this class*.  If you do not, please contact Dr. Glover ASAP. 

### Moodle

Moodle is the WPU course management system. Resources that students need will be linked through moodle, as well as an up-to-date schedule of topics and assignments. Grades will be continuously updated in the gradebook. 

### R and Rstudio

R is a coding language (think python, C++, etc.) commonly used for data science, environmental science, and ecology. Students will use R and the software Rstudio, a user-friendly interface for working in R, for data analysis in class. 

To complete assignments, students will need to download R and Rstudio on their personal computer which they will bring to class. Installation details can be found [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), and will be discussed in class. Both R and Rstudio are free. *Students should not purchase any Rstudio products.*

### Google

WPU provides a google account with your WPU login.  We will use the google applications for:

- Data management: Data files will be shared and organized using google drive.
- Presentation: Students will create a poster presentation using google slides.

### Slack

Slack is a communication platform which can be accessed through an internet browser, desktop client, or mobile app. In this course, we will use slack for troubleshooting R code in class. **For information on how slack will be used in the course see [here](slack_how_to).**

Students are encouraged to ask questions and to engage in slack. Slack will provide a simpler and quicker way to share code during class data analysis activities. 

Slack can be used as a web appliation or you can download a desktop app. To download the desktop app, go to <http://www.slack.com>. Students will receive a link for our class slack workspace the first week in class.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Confidential information should not be discussed in slack, as slack is not FERPA compliant. Please discuss sensitive information, via email.

# Course components

Student grades will be calculated by using a percentage system. All grades will be recorded in Moodle including your current course grade.

Component | Percentage of grade
:-------- | :---------
Data collection | 10%
Scientific writing | 30%
Research project presentation | 15%
Data analysis exams (15% + 20%) | 35%
Participation | 10%
Total | 100%

*Grading scale: A: 90 - 100%, B: 80 – 89.9%, C: 70 – 79.9%, D: 60 – 69.9%, F: < 60%*

Assignment re-grading must be requested through email within 5 days of receiving your grade.  Please email Dr. Glover with justification for your re-grade.

## Data collection (10%)

As a part of the water quality class project, students will measure a variety of water quality metrics of local streams, both in the field and with lab tests. Students are expected to carefully and accurately collect data, record measurements, and make observations. **Students will be responsible for transportation to field locations, but carpooling will be discussed in class.**  

## Scientific writing (30%)

A large focus of this course will be reading scientific articles and scientific writing. Students will practice scientific writing throughout the semester during data analysis projects both in and out of class. The class will include a variety of  writing formats including informative essays for non-experts, scientific reports, and infographics with figures. Students will receive regular feedback on writing assignments from peers and instructors. 

## Data analysis exams (35%)

To assess data analysis skills, students will have two in-class, open note, data analysis exams. Students will be given a dataset which they will analyze and report results. With the data, students may be asked to plot, calculate summary statistics, and write conclusions.

## Research presentation (15%)

Students will create a scientific poster summarizing their class research project on the local water quality. The posters will consist of an introduction, methods, results, and discussion section, utilize credible scientific sources, and include graphs of data collected throughout the semester. 

## Participation (10%)

Students are expected to be engaged and actively participate during class and will be graded accordingly. Much of the student learning will happen through participation in in-class activities, including data analysis and coding, graphing, data collection, peer reviews, and writing assignments. 

Students will be graded on:

- Regular class attendance
- Contribution to class discussions and activities
- Effective use of class time 
- Completion of class activities

## Course schedule

Full details of assignments will be provided on moodle and communicated via email each week. The full schedule of topics will be a fluid document throughout the course to ensure that students have mastered course topics before moving on and to work around weather for field work. All changes will be communicated with students and students will have details for assignments at least one week before they are due.

# Course policies

## Student expectations

Students are expected to attend each class session and to actively participate during class. Students will be assigned background readings and writing assignments for homework, but much of the data analysis and R coding will be completed in class. Coding can be tricky (a missing comma can break your code!) so students should use class time effectively -- in class students can use time to work together or get help from the instructor. 

## Attendance
Class attendance is necessary to be successful in this course. Many of the course assignments and activities will take place in class. Furthermore, it is the student’s responsibility to obtain class notes when absent. 
Students must be present for most of the class period (90 minutes) to be considered present. When possible, please contact Dr. Glover *prior* to a missed class via email, to ensure that you remain on track in the course. Written documentation of excused absence (i.e. illness, court appearance, school approved athletic event) must be submitted to the professor within 3 business days from the missed date of class. Please be advised the University mandates that students attend 80% of the class meetings in order to pass the course.

For student athletes, it is the student’s responsibility to communicate regarding approved absences (university sponsored events and competitions, but not practices) in a timely manner so that work can be completed in advance. Students will not be excused from assignments and will not receive extensions or make up exams unless discussed with the instructor at least one week in advance. 

## Late policy

Timely completion of assignments and activities is crucial for success in this course as tools and content will build on each other throughout the semester. For example, one week, we may learn how to import data into analysis software. This skill will be needed for all subsequent data activities. Students are required to complete and submit previous data assignments before they can continue with class assignments.  

Assignments completed in class or in groups must be submitted on time to receive credit.

Due dates for assignments are provided on Moodle and on the course schedule. Students will also receive a reminder of assignments due before the start of the week. No assignments submitted after the last day of class will receive credit for a grade. *If a student consistently turns in class work late, they will be required to meet with the instructor to discuss.* 

## Code sharing

In addition to scientific writing, students will be writing R code. Students are expected to uphold the academic integrity policy in their code. Unless stated otherwise, all code written should be the student's own. Students are encouraged to work together and can use online resources (such as stack overflow) for issues, but should write their code independently. **Student's may not share R scripts.**

## Additional policies

### Academic Integrity Statement 
William Peace University seeks to develop both the intellect and character of its students. All members of the University are expected to promote a culture of academic integrity, and all students are expected to inform themselves of the University’s policies and procedures related to Academic Integrity. 

All forms of academic misconduct are violations of the University’s Honor Code. These include, but are not limited to: 

- Cheating: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in academic work or in working with others on academic assignments, tests, or other requirements
- Facilitating academic dishonesty: Helping or attempting to help another student to commit an act of academic misconduct  
- Falsification: Falsifying or inventing any information or citation in academic work
- Lying: Misrepresenting information that is relevant to the classroom or academic performance 
- Plagiarism: Representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own in any academic work, whether intentional or not.

If a faculty member suspects academic misconduct has taken place, the faculty member will forward the Academic Integrity Violation Report and all relevant evidence to the Academic Affairs designees and apply the agreed upon grade penalty if the student accepts responsibility. If the student does not accept responsibility, the University Academic Integrity Board is notified and an Academic Integrity Board Hearing is scheduled to determine whether it is more or less likely that the student has violated the academic integrity policy and whether the recommended outcomes should be applied.

### COVID Statement
