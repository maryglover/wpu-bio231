## What is slack?

Slack is a communication platform. It is easy to use and has a lot of features that make it ideal for communicating as a class
 
Some things that you can do in slack:
-   	Write in discussion boards
-   	Send direct messages
-   	Share files
-   	Make one on one video calls

Slack can be used on an internet browser, a desktop client, or a mobile app.
 
### Resources

- [Downloading slack on computer](https://slack.com/downloads/): This is optional. You can also access slack directly on your internet browser
- [Quick start guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide)
- [Detailed help files](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043)

## Set up slack profile

The first thing that you should do is set up your profile in slack. You can do this by clicking the person icon at the top right-hand corner. Then click "Profile"
 
Then you should fill in your information, including your name,  pronouns, and a picture if you wish.

# How to use slack in BIO 231

The primary uses of slack in BIO 231 will be for troubleshooting code issues and asking questions. We will use slack during class coding activities to share code that works for people. Slack has the advantage over Moodle for quick communication and easier sharing of text and files. You can also use slack for direct communication with students (for example for group work) or with your instructor. 
 
**Examples of things you *can* do on slack:**
- Ask the class where to find an assignment in a channel or when something is due
- Post an example of a code and ask why it *isn't* working
- Post a screenshot of an error message and ask for help
- Ask a classmate to clarify a course concept
- Let the instructor know you will be absent from class due to an illness in a DM
- Share a link to an interesting article that you think would interest the class

**Things you *cannot* do on slack:**
- Ask students for answers to class assignments before it is due
- Post exam questions or answers
- Share your entire code file 
- Share confidential information. 

*Do not share confidential information on slack.* Slack is not FERPA compliant, so discussion of sensitive information, such as individual grades, should be done through email with Dr. Glover (mmglover@peace.edu)

## Channels

Slack uses channels to organize conversation.
 
Below is a list of the channels for BIOL 102 and what should be posted in each.

### \#welcome

This channel is for introductions, sharing interesting articles, class reminders, or general class questions. 

### \#data-analysis

This will likely be the main channel that we use for class. Here, we will discuss data analysis or coding activites. You can ask questions here about the class activities or general R questions.  

### \#science-writing

We will be doing a variety of scientfic reading and writing activities. This channel is for science writing related quesions. 

### \#tech-help

We will be using a variety or computer resources or technology which can be challenging to get up and running. Use this channel for questions related to technology or platform issues. 

You can use the DMs or channels to ask questions in slack. However, it is *strongly recommended* that you use the channels for questions. It is likely that other classmates have the same questions as you do, and therefore will benefit from your question in the channel. Also, students can answer questions in the channels. This will mean that you may get a quicker response than if you DM'd your instructor instead. To direct a question in a channel to Dr. Glover, you can use the mention function. This will send a notification. To use mentions, use the @, (@Dr. Glover)
