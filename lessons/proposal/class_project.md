Today in class, we will explore the City of Raleigh water quality data to understand the types of data in the dataset. Students will make summaries of the data using tools from unit 1. Students will also develop project proposals of what questions they will work on for the remainder of the semester.

Students should use the new posit Rstudio project titled "Water_quality_analysis" in class. This project already has some data and packages loaded.
